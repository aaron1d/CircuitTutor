This is/was meant to be React-Redux app to outline the analytical solution of circuit problems à la Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis by Irwin & Nelms. The plan is/was to add roughly one mode per solution method. 

The enumeration of nodes and meshes are almost done, as (almost) is that of the Schematic. I want to add analysis modes for KVL, KCL, Thévenin/Norton, op-amps (no three-terminal devices yet0, superposition, transient analysis, steady-state analysis, etc.

Suitable libraries for a javascript CAS are sparse...
